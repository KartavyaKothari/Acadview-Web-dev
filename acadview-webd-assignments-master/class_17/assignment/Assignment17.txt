Your task is to improve this web application by accepting input from user via input elements and create new row with that input in a table.


	// Find a <table> element with id="myTable":
	var table = document.querySelector("myTable");

	// Create an empty <tr> element and add it to the 1st position of the 			table:
	var row = table.insertRow(0);

	// Insert new cells (<td> elements) at the 1st and 2nd position of the 		"new" <tr> element:
	var cell1 = row.insertCell(0);
	var cell2 = row.insertCell(1);

	// Add some text to the new cells:
	cell1.innerHTML = "NEW CELL1";
	cell2.innerHTML = "NEW CELL2";
