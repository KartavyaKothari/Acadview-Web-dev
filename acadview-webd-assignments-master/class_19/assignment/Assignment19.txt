Step 1: clone the boilerplate code by following commands on your terminal/git bash:

git clone https://github.com/kumarsandeep91/PersistanceDemo.git

Step 2: Inside PersistanceDemo folder just downloaded/cloned you will find that this is the solution of assignment 15 (contact manager). 

Now your task is to improve this so that contacts can be saved in localStorage in the browser when we click add contact button.

Explaination :
		The localStorage  properties allow to save key/value pairs in a 	web browser.
	
	The localStorage object stores data with no expiration date. The data will 	not be deleted when the browser is closed, and will be available the next 	day, week, or year.

	
	Syntax

	window.localStorage

	Syntax for SAVING data to localStorage:

	localStorage.setItem("key", "value");

	Syntax for READING data from localStorage:

	var lastname = localStorage.getItem("key");

	Syntax for REMOVING data from localStorage:

	localStorage.removeItem("key");
