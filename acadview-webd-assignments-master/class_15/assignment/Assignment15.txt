Step 1: clone the boilerplate code by following commands on your terminal/git bash:

git clone https://github.com/kumarsandeep91/ES6Demo.git

Step 2: Inside ES6Demo folder just downloaded/cloned open index.html and follow TODO comments inside script tag.

TODO : create a ES6 class named Contact with two properties:
	also define constructor 



       One way to define a class is using a class declaration. To declare a 		       class, you use the class keyword with the name of the class ("Rectangle"           here).
	
	E.g-
	
	class Rectangle {
        	constructor(height, width) {
    			this.height = height;
    			this.width = width;
  	  	}
	}
