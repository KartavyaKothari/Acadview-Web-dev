Step2: Text alignment

 Easily realign text to components with text alignment classes.

 For left, right, and center alignment, responsive classes are available that use the same viewport width breakpoints as the grid system.

Step2: Example with list-group 
 
  Scrollspy also works with .list-groups. Scroll the area next to the list group and watch   the active class change.

  Syntax : <div id="list-example" class="list-group"> 
          Item 1 some paragraph
          <a class="list-group-item list-group-item-action" href="#list-item-1">Item 1</a>

step3: page layout
 
  How it works
	 
  Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to layout and   align content.

  It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive. Below is an example and an in-depth look   at how the grid comes together.
