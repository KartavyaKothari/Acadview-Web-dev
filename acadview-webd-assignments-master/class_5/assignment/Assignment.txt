Step:1 Function 

	A function is a group of instructions that performs a particular task.

	Here's a basic example of a function.

      function grettingJavaScript()
	{
    	console.log("Message !");
        }

	console.log("Start of program");
	grettingJavaScript();
	console.log("End of program");

		Declaring a function

	Check out the first lines of the example above

	syntax function grettingJavaScript()     ///grettingJavaScript its function name 	you can write  any name here
 	{
    	console.log("Message !");
 	}
	This creates a function called grettingJavaScript(). It consists of only one 	statement that will make a message appear in the console: "Message !"


Step2: Creating a function is called declaration:


	The declaration of a function is performed using the JavaScript keyword function, 	followed by the function name and a pair of parentheses. Instructions that make up 	the function constitute the body of the function. These instructions are enclosed 	in curly braces and indented.

	console.log("Start of program");
	grettingJavaScript();
	console.log("End of program");

	The first and third statements explicitly display messages in the console. The 	second line makes a call to the function grettingJavaScript() .

	You can call a function by writing the name of the function followed by a pair of 	parentheses. 

	// ...
	grettingjavaScript(); // Call myFunction
	// ...
